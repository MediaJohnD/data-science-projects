# Data Science Projects

This repository contains a small set of modules illustrating a typical data
science workflow. The code is intentionally simple and serves as a starting
point for further experimentation.

## Project Structure

- `src/ingestion` – utilities to load datasets.
- `src/features` – basic feature engineering helpers.
- `src/modeling` – example model training code.
- `src/scoring` – a minimal FastAPI service used for scoring.
- `src/monitoring` – runtime metrics logging.
- `src/resolution` – entity resolution helpers.
- `src/contextual_triggers` – lightweight event trigger logic.
- `docs` – additional documentation.

Run the unit tests with:

```bash
pytest -q
```
